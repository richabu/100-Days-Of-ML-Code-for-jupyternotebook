# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code-for-jypyternotebook
Basically, this is a "light" version for my convenience of self-learning. <br>
The codes are copied and adapted from [Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code.git). <br>
These codes are for jupyter notebook users to learn ML.
